# Alexa_Flashcards
Hackathon project worked on in 2018 at Arizona State University

The goal was to successfully code out vocabulary index card Alexa commands in Amazon echo dot.
When a user says, "Alexa, create flashcards" 
Then Alexa will ask for a word that user want to input.
Then user say a word the user wants.
Alexa will then ask what definition user want to put into the back of the flashcard
Then user say the definition the user wants.
It will repeat until the user says stop.
After Alexa saves all vocabulary words in flashcard, user can say "Test me on the flashcard defintion or words"
Alexa will then say definition or words and the user test themselves out.


Unfortunately, my team and I didn't get any far with this project
